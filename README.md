# UCR1_INS
This repo contains the code for the UCR-01 Inertial Navigation System (INS) project. This project runs on an STM32G474RE microcontroller that lives on the UCR-01's gnss_imu board. 

The job of this project is to receive data from a Novatel OEM7600 GNSS receiver that is paired with an Epson EG320 IMU. The data is received over UART, parsed by the microncontroller, and then shipped over FDCAN to the UCR-01's CAN logger.

## TODOs:
- We would like to receive serialized messages over the CAN bus that will configure what logs the GNSS receiver should output so we do not have to pull it out and connect over UART to configure it
    - Novatel already provides the ability to receieve serialized commands over UART, so this could be as simple as forwarding messages received over CAN to the receiver
    - Converting GNSS commands to binary can be a bit of a chore, (Novatel provides a c++ project that can do this that someone has also converted into a python pip module, but it is still a bit of a chore) so I would recommend implementing our own more simple serialization for a specfic subset of commands that we would realistically use
- The Core/vendor_generated/can_tools code, generated by the can_tools pip module, will be stored in the UCR0X_CANDBC repository in the future. We should make this repo a submodule so the generated can_tools files do not need to be manually generated when changes are made to the candbc file
